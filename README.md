# PIC32 DC Motor Controller
A low-level brushed DC motor controller built from scratch using a PIC32MX170F256B microcontroller. This project implements real-time current and position control using a cascaded control architecture, UART-based command interface, and Python host-side terminal for tuning and visualization.
